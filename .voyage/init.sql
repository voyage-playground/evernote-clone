A car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air, she had a plan.\nThere are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn\'t tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you did.\nIt\'s always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn\'t have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.', 'Interview Notes', 0, '2016-02-12 17:37:49', '2021-04-21 18:38:37'),
(2, 1, 'The words hadn\'t flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks. He never imagined he\'d find himself with writer\'s block, but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him. That blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind. He didn\'t understand why he couldn\'t even type a single word, just one to begin the process and build from there. And yet, he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank.', 'Lot\'s of words', 0, '2016-02-12 18:10:30', '2021-04-21 18:38:09'),

Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn\'t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.', 'Meeting Notes', 0, '2016-05-21 16:20:46', '2021-04-21 18:36:50'),

I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it.\nTurning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sun√¢??s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.', 'It\'s not my fault', 0, '2016-05-28 21:07:48', '2021-04-21 18:38:23'),

The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn\'t and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.', 'Hopes and Dreams', 0, '2016-07-06 00:30:01', '2021-04-21 18:37:58'),

There was no time to double-check to make sure they weren\'t leaving something important behind. Everything was thrown into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all.\nI\'m going to hire professional help tomorrow. I can\'t handle this anymore. She fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter. This is much more than I ever signed up to do.\nHer mom had warned her. She had been warned time and again, but she had refused to believe her. She had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion. So when the promotion was given to her main rival, it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray. It was her first big lesson in life, but not the last.', 'New book notes', 0, '2016-09-02 19:47:52', '2021-04-21 18:37:43'),

I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It\'s better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and marshmallows -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. All things in moderation, friends.

Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe, they had been happy together.\nIt was a scrape that he hardly noticed. Sure, there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures. There was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream.

It wasn\'t a matter of if she was going to try and save it, but a matter of how she was going to save it. She went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone.\nSometimes that\'s just the way it has to be. Sure, there were probably other options, but he didn\'t let them enter his mind. It was done and that was that.
